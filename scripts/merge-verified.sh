# merge-verified.sh — the merge gate as a tool (#181 R1, period retro 2026-09-24).
#
# Never merge on a piped or tailed view: `gh pr checks --watch | tail` hides
# failing lanes and masks the exit code (2026-09-23: two merges landed with
# three red lanes behind a tailed view). This script watches the checks to
# terminal state, then reads the COMPLETE rollup, refuses on any `fail` or
# `pending` line — and on a PR that reports no checks at all — and only then
# merges. A background watcher's exit code is advisory; the rollup is the
# verdict.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/merge-verified.sh                       # PR inferred from the current branch
#   scripts/merge-verified.sh <pr-number>           # repository inferred from the remote
#   scripts/merge-verified.sh <owner/repo> <pr>     # both explicit
#
# The merge is a merge commit (--merge, the house style); the remote branch is
# NOT deleted — remote deletions take the owner's word.
#
# Exits 0 after merging; exits non-zero WITHOUT merging when any check is
# failing or pending, the rollup is empty/unreadable, or the PR is not open.
